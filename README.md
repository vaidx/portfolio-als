Portfolio Analysis in Python

This project uses Python to analyse and visualize a portfolio to display the following metrics:

1. Portfolio Allocations and Asset Weightage
2. Risk Profile (Based on Standard Deviation or SD)
3. Sharpe Ratio
4. Sortino Ratio

The program will calculate expected portfolio returns using two Machine Learning models, 
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
2. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), 
and then suggest relevant optimization techniques for the user to 
- maximize Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
- minimize drawdown.
